== Groovy

Okay, so you've seen this project and wondered WTF is http://groovy-lang.org[Groovy]. You've made some research, and seen how awesome it is.

So, do you want to use it on your Android application development? Here's how.

=== Android Studio

First of all, Android Studio has native Groovy support, so here you don't really have to add anything.

IMPORTANT: Every Groovy class or Java class which references a Groovy one must be inside of `src/main/groovy` instead of `src/main/java`. To add a Groovy class you'll only need to create your new Class files as a `.groovy` file, instead of a Java class (you could define your own template).

=== Gradle

In order to make Android Studio compile your Android Groovy code, you will need a plugin which is under development. You will have to make a few changes at your module's build.gradle:

[source, groovy]
.build.gradle
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.0.0'
        classpath 'org.codehaus.groovy:gradle-groovy-android-plugin:0.3.5'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'groovyx.grooid.groovy-android'

android {
    ...
    packagingOptions {
        // workaround for http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20673625/android-gradle-plugin-0-7-0-duplicate-files-during-packaging-of-apk
        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'
        exclude 'META-INF/groovy-release-info.properties'
    }
}

dependencies{
    compile 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy:2.4.0-rc-2:grooid'
}
----

After this little edits, you're ready to start using Groovy in your Android development.
