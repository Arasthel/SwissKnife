== DSL Methods - aka method extensions

What we call 'DSL Methods' are actually 'Extension Methods'.

Still no clue of what those are?

Imagine you have GPS coordinates in (lat, lon) format, with lat and lon being doubles. If you want to show that on screen, you'd have to format them as 'String' with a desired number of decimal positions.

So you could write in *Java*:

[source, java]
.DoubleUtils.java
----
public class DoubleUtils {

    public static String doubleWithDecimals(double number, int decimals) {
        String parseDef = "#."+"0"*decimals
        DecimalFormat formatter = new DecimalFormat(parseDef)
        return formatter.format(number)
    }
}
----

But why do you have to add a whole class just for that - or even worse, mix it with some random code?

Wouldn't this method fit perfectly inside the 'Double' class?

Well, in *Groovy* that can be done and is quite simple. You could write an extension method and just use:

[source, groovy]
----
// Actually, Groovy does have ".trunc(int)" extension method for that
String coordStr = coordinate.withDecimals(4)
----

So if that can be done to data classes, why shouldn't we use it on Android?

Short answer is: *we do.*

=== Types of DSL methods

The DSL methods written so far can be classified on these big groups:

* *View* methods.
* *Context* methods.
* *Fragment* methods.
* *Bundle* methods.
* *Event* methods.
* *Misc* methods.

=== View methods

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).view(int id, (Optional)Closure modifier)

A short for `findViewById(int)`, can be used from *Activity, View and Fragment* instances.

The optional closure is a way to modify the retrieved item.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
def myTextView = activity.view(R.id.text_view) {
    def textView = it as TextView
    textView.setText("Hi there!")
}
----

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).text(int id, (Optional)Closure modifier)

Retrieves a View, but it is downcasted to `TextView` before it's returned and configured using the optional closure. Can be used from *Activity, View and Fragment* instances.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
def myTextView = activity.text(R.id.text_view) {
    it.setText("Hi there!")
}
----

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).editText(int id, (Optional)Closure modifier)

Retrieves a View, but it is downcasted to `EditText` before it's returned and configured using the optional closure. Can be used from *Activity, View and Fragment* instances.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
def myEditText = activity.editText(R.id.edittext) {
    it.setHint("Type your name")
}
----

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).button(int id, (Optional)Closure modifier)

Retrieves a View, but it is downcasted to `Button` before it's returned and configured using the optional closure. Can be used from *Activity, View and Fragment* instances.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
def myButton = activity.button(R.id.button) {
    it.setBackgroundColor(color)
}
----

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).image(int id, (Optional)Closure modifier)

Retrieves a View, but it is downcasted to `ImageView` before it's returned and configured using the optional closure. Can be used from *Activity, View and Fragment* instances.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
def myImageVIew = activity.image(R.id.image_view) {
    it.setDrawable(R.drawable.photo)
}
----

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).asListView(int id, ListAdapter adapter)

Retrieves a `ListView`, applying the provided adapter to it. Can be used from *Activity, View and Fragment* instances.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
def listView = activity.asListView(R.id.list_view, adapter)
----

==== (Iterable).asListView(Context context, int id, int rowLayoutId, (Optional) Closure closure)

Retrieves a `ListView` and configures it. Can be used from *an Iterable instance*, such as *List, Set*, etc. The internal adapter is a `GArrayAdapter` which executes the `closure` param to configure the rows.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
myListOfStrings.asListView(context, R.id.list_view, R.layout.list_row) { String item, View view ->
    view.text(R.id.title) {
        it.setText(item)
    }
}
----

==== (View|Fragment|Activity).asListView(int id, int rowLayoutId, Iterable items, (Optional) Closure closure)

Retrieves a `ListView` and configures it. Can be used from *Acitvity, Fragment or View* instances. The internal adapter is a `GArrayAdapter` which executes the `closure` param to configure the rows.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
containerView.asListView(R.id.list_view, R.layout.list_row, items) { String item, View view ->
    view.text(R.id.title) {
        it.setText(item)
    }
}
----

==== (ListView).onItem(int rowLayoutId, Iterable items, (Optional) Closure closure)

Creates a `GArrayAdapter` which will execute the closure to configure the rows. Can be used from a *ListView* instance.

_Example:_

[source, groovy]
----
listView.onItem(R.layout.list_row, items) { String item, View view ->
    view.text(R.id.title) {
        it.setText(item)
    }
}
----
