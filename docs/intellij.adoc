== Intellij Plugin

You can find it on http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7538?pr=[JetBrains Plugin Repo].

Using the plugin is really simple. You just have to install it, go to a Groovy class and open Generate menu. There, you will find this:

image::intellij-2.jpg[]

Then, you select the desired annotation and a list of compatible methods will be shown:

After you select one, the desired method will be appended to your class:

The names of the methods and variables can be changed to whatever you want if you keep the argument list structure.
