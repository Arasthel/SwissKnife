SwissKnife
==========


<div align="center"><img src="./SwissKnife.png"></div>

A multi-purpose *Groovy* library containing view injection and threading for Android using annotations. It's based on both [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/) and [AndroidAnnotations](https://github.com/excilys/androidannotations).

With **SwissKnife** you can:

* Inject views dynamically on *any Object* as long a you have a View to find them. No more ``findViewById`` and **you don't have to extend any classes**.
* Add callback methods to several actions using ``@OnClick``, ``@OnItemClick``, etc.
* Execute methods in the UI Thread or a background one using ``@OnUIThread`` and ``@OnBackground``.

You can see an example here:

```groovy
class MyActivity extends Activity {

  @OnClick(R.id.button)
  public void onButtonClicked(Button button) {
    Toast.makeText(this, "Button clicked", Toast.LENGTH_SHOT).show();
  }

  @OnBackground
  public void doSomeProcessing(URL url) {
    // Contents will be executed on background
    ...
  }

  @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        // This must be called for injection of views and callbacks to take place
        SwissKnife.inject(this);
    }
}
```

I would also like to thank **[@Dexafree](https://github.com/dexafree)** for his help writing the wiki, testing the library and creating the sample app, which contains some usage examples.

You can find a **CHANGELOG** [here](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Using it

To use SwissKnife **you must use Groovy on your Android project** as the code generation is done using AST processing, which is a Groovy feature. You can learn how to do that using [this plugin](https://github.com/melix/groovy-android-gradle-plugin) on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife/wiki/How-to-use-Groovy).

Once your project App Module is configured to use Groovy you can add this library as a dependency cloning it with ``git clone`` or as a maven library on the **build.gradle** of your App Module:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.arasthel:swissknife:1.0.4'
    ...
}

```

Also, [there is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://github.com/Arasthel/SwissKnife/wiki/SwissKnife-IDEA-Plugin) *compatible with Android Studio* that lets you auto-generate the annotations and compatible method declarations.
